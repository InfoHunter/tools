Github statistics gathering
===========================

There are two scripts:

contributor-collect	- Collects data from github.  To be used carefully and
			  not too often, as it pulls ALL PRs and ALL reviews
			  made in them, as well as ALL issues and ALL comments
			  made in those.  Its result is written to standard
			  output.

contributor-check	- Uses cached data from contributor-collect to present
			  statistics over a date range.  Reads the data from
			  standard input.

Synopsis
--------

perl contributor-collect owner repo > cachefile

perl contributor-check startdate[YYYYMMDD] enddate[YYYYMMDD] < cachefile


Configuration
-------------

contributor-collect needs configuring with authentication data, either like
this:

    {
        authentication => [ access_token => 'XXXXXXXX....' ]
    }

or like this:

    {
        authentication => [ login => 'username', pass => 'password' ]
    }
